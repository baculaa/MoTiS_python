1. Open one of the aadi computers
       - Password is “password”
2. Plug both USB cables into the back of the laptop
       - Lidar should start spinning
3. Turn on the robot with the switch on the left hand side
4. Open a blank terminal on the laptop
       - cd catkin_ws/src/pioneer_test
       - ./run-pioneer-robot

       This is the base demo of the robot to be able to send it commands with Rviz. It launches:
        - RosAria (required)
        - pioneer_sensors (required)
        - nav_bundle (to run navstack, not required if using a different path planning method)
        - pioneer_controller (not required if using own controller)
        - Rviz (not required)

You can create your own folder in the src directory and make a new version of run-pioneer-robot with your required launch files
DO NOT CHANGE WHAT IS IN THE SRC FOLDER! JUST ADD YOUR OWN FOLDER WITHIN SRC AND EDIT THERE
